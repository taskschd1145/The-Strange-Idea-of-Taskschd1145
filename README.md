## What is this?
This is a NeoForge mod for Minecraft 1.21.1, 
featuring various whimsical and peculiar creations that I have thought of over time.
### Which versions does it support?
It only supports Minecraft 1.21.1 with NeoForge.
## How should I install this mod?
Make sure you have the latest version of Java installed (Java 21 or above).
Open the Releases section, and download the latest version,
If you do not have Minecraft, you should [purchase](https://minecraft.net/) a copy.<br/>
Open your Minecraft Launcher and download the 1.21.1 version,<br/>
Launch the game once, then exit,<br/>
Go to the [NeoForge download page](https://projects.neoforged.net/neoforged/neoforge), select 1.21.1 and the latest NeoForge version,<br/>
Open the downloaded JAR installation file; if double-clicking does not work, open a terminal and execute the following command:<br/>
```bash
java -jar <jar_file_name>.jar
```
After opening, please select Install client,<br/>
Once the installation is complete, place the mod file in the Mods folder.<br/>
Enjoy!
